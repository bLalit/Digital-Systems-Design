"# Digital-Systems-Design" 
I built a 32x8 RAM using 16x4 RAM along with which I used a debounced toggle switch as a clock, for the next class project, I designed and built a multiplier circuit and my design took 4 clock cycles to compete the multiplication of 2 4-bit numbers. For my final class project, I learnt and built a 4-bit CPU which executes several RTL instructions. Along with this, I also used an Altera FPGA Cyclone IV board and worked on Quartus prime to code in VHDL and perform the same tasks of a multiplier and a 4-bit CPU as I had on my hardware design.
